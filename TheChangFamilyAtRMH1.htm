      Chang and his wife, Ting-Chu Su, brought their three boys, ages 6, 10 and 
      14, from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to the Twin Cities on January 20, 2005, to seek 
      treatment at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. The three boys 
      all have the rare adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) disease. The middle one has 
      been paralyzed. When the parents learned of this disease three years ago, 
      they did everything they could to save the kids. The mother went on to the 
      Internet and found Dr. Hugo W. Moser at the Johns Hopkins hospital who had 
      treated a kid with a similar disease in a movie titled &quot;Lorenzo's Oil&quot;. 
      She wrote an e-mail letter to him, asking for help. Dr. Moser answered her 
      request the next day. He suggested the parents bring the other two kids 
      immediately to the U Medical Center to be examined by Dr. Charles Peters 
      for a bone marrow transplant. But the parents did not have the money to 
      make the trip. It was estimated that it would take up to $500,000 to treat 
      each kid with BMT. Their story was soon posted on the Internet and a newspaper 
      in Taiwan started a fundraising campaign. The Taiwanese people responded 
      quickly and generously by donating more than $2 million in three days to 
      the Chang family. After their arrival, the Changs lived at the <a href="http://www.rmhmpls.com/">Ronald 
      McDonald House</a> from January to July, waiting for the bone marrow transplant. 
      They moved out of the Ronald McDonald House on August 1 and now stay in 
      an apartment in downtown St. Paul. The U Medical Center apparently decided 
      not to do the bone marrow transplant for the oldest Chang boy, but did not 
      provide a specific reason, citing patient's privacy. The Ronald McDonald 
      House did not want to speculate why the Changs moved out of the House.<font color="#ffffcc">xxxxxxx
