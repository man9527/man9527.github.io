              John Ko, president of TAAMN, hosted a welcome dinner reception (see 
              photos below) at the Ho Ho Restaurant and made arrangement for them

              Cyclist Chin-Pao Huang, 44, his wife, Li-Chun Yang, 39, and their 
              two sons Chien-Chia, 19 and Tsung-Fu, 16, left Taipei, Taiwan on 
              July 10, 2002. They traveled across Hong Kong, China, Pakistan, 
              Afghanistan, Iran, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, 
              and Netherlands. On their way, they biked through deserts, snow 
              storms and war zones. They camped most of the times, but also stayed 
              in schools, churches, hospitals, restaurants, mosques, motels, homes, 
              and even a jail cell in Iran because they could not find a place 
              to spend the night. They were often welcomed as guests. During their 
              sojourn in the Twin Cities, some members of TAAMN took them to visit 
              Science Museum of Minnesota, <a href="javascript:location='bikefamilyfromtaiwan.htm';window.open('huangsandwenlin.htm','twincities','height=435,width=550,scrollbars=no')">Mall

              People in Taiwan call the bike a steel horse. Chin-Pao, a welder 
              who owns a small shop that makes metal windows and doors, came up 
              with this idea to see the world on bicycle about two years ago.

              Although his family members are experienced cyclists, they first 
              thought that he was crazy and it was impossible to pedal around 
              the world. Chin-Pao stuck to his plan. Knowing that Chin-Pao would 
              not give up his dream of biking through different countries, his 
              wife and their two sons joined him to tour the world on their steel 
              horses. <br>

              The Huangs packed more than 100 pounds of supplies on their specially 
              designed bikes. They rode on average about 60 miles a day. They 
              arrived in New York at the end of April and went through Albany, 
              Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago and other cities. They left Chicago 
              on June 3 and entered Minnesota several days ahead of their schedule, 
              staying in the Twin Cities for a week to rest and restock their 
              supplies. The Huangs attended a <a href="javascript:location='bikefamilyfromtaiwan.htm';window.open('HuangsAtSummerPicnic.htm','twincities','height=435,width=550,scrollbars=no')">summer 
              picnic</a> hosted by TAAMN on June 14. About 160 people came to 
              meet with them. <a href="BikeFamilyFromTaiwanInWorldJournal1.htm">They 
              departed on June 15</a> and continued their journey via Fargo, Minot 
              and Spokane to Seattle. <a href="javascript:location='bikefamilyfromtaiwan.htm';window.open('HuangsLeavingRedLionHotel.htm','twincities','height=435,width=550,scrollbars=no')">John 
              Ko</a> and several TAAMN members, including Sung-Peng Hsu, Chi-Ming 
              Tseng and Shu-Yun Tseng, went to the hotel to bid them goodbye.

              Lu and Ying-Yuh Lu biked with them for nearly three hours</a>. Lilian 
              Lai, Chung-Linn Kao and Tsan-Kuo Chang followed them by car. They 
              saw the bike family off near Highway 10 in Blaine. The bike family 
              reached Seattle on July 24 and flew to San Francisco on July 30.

              They left for Taiwan on August 13, after touring the world on bikes 
              for a total of 14,750 miles (23,733 kilometers). The Huangs are 
              the first family from Taiwan, and probably in the world, to do so. 
              <a href="BikeFamilyStoryAboutTwinCitiesStop.htm">Their story was 
              later published in a book that covered the Twin Cities stop</a>. 
              Three years after their journey started in 2002, the bike family's 
              story still fascinated an American publisher. The New York based 
              McGraw-Hill included the story in <i><a href="BikeFamilyInReadOn3News.htm">Read 
              On 3</a></i> in 2006.</div>
