            <p><font color="#333333">Founded by the Taiwanese puppet master Li 
              Tien-Lu in 1931, I Wan Jan (pronounced yi-wan-ran) Puppet Theater 
              is among the oldest puppet theaters and the most acclaimed one in 
              Taiwan. The name &quot;I Wan Jan&quot; refers to the remarkably 
              lifelike glove puppets. Master Li died in 1998. The story of Li 
              Tien-Lu and his traditional Taiwanese puppetry were the subject 
              of a movie titled &quot;The Puppetmaster.&quot; Directed by Hou 
              Hsiao-Hsien, it won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 Cannes Film 
              Festival. </font></p>
