                      Lai Memorial Scholarship</a>. Six applications were received 
                      from graduate students at the U who were all well qualified 
                      and had impressive academic and professional credentials.

                    <p>The seven-member committee reviewed each application carefully 
                      and voted to award Ms. Wang the scholarship. Members of 
                      the committee were Tsan-Kuo Chang, Cheng-Cher Huang, Ching-Chang

                      University in 2000. She came to the United States in the 
                      same year to pursue a biology major in the College of Biological 
                      Sciences at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Upon 
                      receiving her bachelor degree in biology in 2003, she was 
                      accepted by the Medical School. &quot;My long term goal 
                      is to become the most skilled and compassionate physician 
                      I can. I came to the United States for medical education 
                      because I want to learn not only the up-to-date medical 
                      knowledge but also the art of healing. No matter where I 
                      practice after my medical training, I envision myself using 
                      my skills and knowledge to give back to the Taiwanese community,&quot;
