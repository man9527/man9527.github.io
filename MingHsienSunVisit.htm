                at large from Taiwan, received a Distinguished Leadership Award 
                for Internationals from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities 
                on October 7, 2005. Sun and his wife arrived at the Twin Cities 
                on October 6.</p>
              <p align="left">The Distinguished Leadership Award for Internationals 
                was inaugurated in 2003 by the U in recognition of the distinguished 
                leadership of international alumni in many different countries 
                and fields. In the first two years, the university recognized 
                14 outstanding alumni for their accomplishments. This year, six 
                recipients were selected from around the World. Dr. Sun was the 
                only recipient from Asia.</p>
              <p align="left">Sun received an MA degree from the U in 1966 and 
                earned a Ph.D. from Purdue University in 1971. He served as the 
                Agricultural Commissioner in Taiwan from 1992 to 1996. He is currently 
                an ambassador at large and the board chair of AVRDC-The World 
                Vegetable Center in Taiwan.</p>
