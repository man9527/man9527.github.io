		<td>About 100 people, including the kids, attended the picnic at the <b>
		<i>Hyland Lake Park</i> </b>on <i>June 10, 2006</i>. The weather was just 
		right. With the rain in the forecast and cool temperature, the park was 
		not crowded at all and we had plenty of space to move around. The sun 
		hid behind the cloud all the time when we were there. Our activities 
		included walking, biking, fishing, canoeing, and water biking. Kids got 
		to play in the super playground. A few people got drafted to play the softball game in a neighboring 
		field that we did not have enough people left to play a volleyball game. The lunch box was prepared by Evergreen restaurant. 
		Five water melons were all sweet and juicy.&nbsp; After the meal, 
		Lily Wang gave a group lessen on social dancing 101. You could tell from 
		the pictures that the participants really had a good time.&nbsp; The picnic was 
		concluded at around 8:00 pm.
		<p>Even though we planned to play a group game for people to know each 
		other, we did not get to do it at the picnic because of the weather 
		condition. Hopefully we can do it next year. And for sure, we would try 
		to rent the Sunnyside picnic area, instead of the Island View. </p>
		<p>I did not get the chances to take the pictures of all the activities. 
		If you happened to have taken pictures at the picnic and are willing to share 
		them with others via our website, please send them to me.&nbsp; Thanks.
