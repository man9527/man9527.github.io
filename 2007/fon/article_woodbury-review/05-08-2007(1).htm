		Looking at the gallery of paintings and murals that canvas the Maplewood 
		home of Susan Liu, who was born in Taiwan, it would appear she has been 
		painting her whole life. Although her art career did not start until age 
		40, her collection depicts images starting from her culture growing up 
		in Taiwan to those from recent vacations and of people she knows.<br>
		<br>
		&quot;This is the best thing in the world for me. For me it's the highest 
		dream I can have,&quot; Liu said during an interview at her home.<br>
		<br>
		Included in the art portfolio that covers her walls are large murals 
		which represent another aspect of her life. <br>
		<br>
		Since 1992 Liu's floor-to-ceiling murals have been featured at a 
		Taiwanese exhibit at the Festival of Nations, held each May at the 
		RiverCentre in St. Paul. <br>
		<br>
		The festival this year was May 3 through May 6 and Liu's mural 
		&quot;Taiwanese Games and Toys&quot; was a part of the overall exhibit 
		representing the country. <br>
		<br>
		More than 90 ethnic groups from around the world were part of this 
		year's festival, depicting the common theme of toys, games and sports, 
		through food, art, clothing, dance performances and cultural exhibits.
		<br>
		<br>
		&quot;The mural for this year, and others, shows people and different aspects 
		of the culture all in one,&quot; Liu says. <br>
		<br>
		Her painting depicts children playing sports popular in Taiwan combined 
		with a temple and a vision of mountains and the city of Taipei in the 
		background. <br>
		<br>
		Liu says painting the temple involved less detail than painting the 
		people in the mural. &quot;When making so many kids, so many people, (it) 
		takes the most time.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		<b>A group process </b><br>
		Through the Minnesota chapter of the Taiwanese Association of America, 
		Liu became involved with the Festival of Nations in 1987. </font>
		<p><font color="#000000" face="ARIAL, SANS SERIF" size="2">It was that 
		year that the Taiwanese exhibit won its first of 17 awards of excellence 
		at the Inaugural Cultural Exhibits Competition, according to the 
		association's Web site. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;This is an opportunity to get all the people who are interested 
		together,&quot; Liu says. <br>
		<br>
		Just as more people from the association have become involved in the 
		festival, Liu's murals have gradually become more of a presence in the 
		annual exhibit and her home.<br>
		<br>
		The association's volunteers research on how the exhibit should portray 
		the festival's theme began last November, Liu says.<br>
		<br>
		Her painting. however, began at the end of February, she says. &quot;I have 
		to paint under pressure.&quot;<br>

		Then the process switches from broad strokes to touching up details and 
		dabbing the last strokes of paint on the mural, which Liu could find 
		herself doing endlessly. To help her be satisfied with the mural and 
		consider it complete, Liu says she will sign her name a week before she 
		is finished. &quot;I kind of just gradually accept it.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Through the festival and the Taiwanese association Eugene Tsai has 
		become a long-time friend with Liu. <br>
		<br>
		He says Susan's murals are the most important part of her overall 
		contribution to the annual exhibit at the Festival of Nations. &quot;We saw 
		that Susan was able to paint. By painting every year she really excelled 
		herself,&quot; Tsai says. </font>
		<p><font color="#000000" face="ARIAL, SANS SERIF" size="2"><b>Cultural 
		influences</b><br>
		In some ways Liu does consider the murals she has painted as &quot;practice&quot; 
		for other types of work she would like to complete. <br>
		<br>
		The journey, however, that brought her to be an artist and to move to 
		the United States also may have been a factor leading to what Liu has 
		accomplished today. <br>
		<br>
		She moved here in 1974 to earn her master's degree in social work at 
		Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. <br>
		<br>
		The career of social work and communicating with clients was difficult 
		for Liu because of her accent and language barriers. She again went back 
		to school and became a computer programmer until she retired and finally 
		moved on to her lifetime passion ... art. <br>
		<br>
		School in Taiwan did include art classes, Liu says. &quot;I enjoyed all the 
		classes (where) I didn't need to do homework. I enjoyed art. I always 
		got an 'A' but (I) never had anyone say I had talent.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Liu's art accomplishments are big, but her culture and influences 
		growing up have kept her modest and humble about what she has achieved. 
		She says growing up in Taiwanese culture meant that her parents would 
		always criticize their children more often than praising them. <br>
		<br>
		&quot;Her passion to paint is from (when) she was very young. She felt very 
		compelled to paint so she is almost like a self-made artist,&quot; Tsai says 
		of his friend.<br>
		<br>
		In school, students were given entrance exams for junior high school and 
		senior high school, Liu says. However one year she failed an entrance 
		exam and did not get her first choice of school. &quot;That experience, it 
		impacted me all my life. From then on I ranked in the middle. I'm always 
		ranked in the middle when I look at my paintings. That's kind of a force 
		for me to try to improve,&quot; she says. <br>
		<br>
		Years later, even after she had completed her first painting at age 40, 
		Liu says a visit from her mother and comments of no art on the walls in 
		her first home brought out some of her creations. <br>
		<br>
		Now, the first painting she completed is at her brother's home in 
		Hawaii, Liu says. <br>
		<br>
		Since her involvement in the Festival of Nations, some additional murals 
		Liu has completed have found homes locally. <br>
		<br>
		One, &quot;Asian Cultures,&quot; is featured at the Asian American Student Union 
		at the University of Minnesota. The other, &quot;Around the World&quot; adorns the 
		wall at the Century College Multi-cultural Center.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Lessons learned</b><br>
		Liu has taken some art classes over time and has even taught her friends 
		basic painting skills she has developed.<br>
		<br>
		Although she is retired now and not painting as a career, Liu does in 
		some ways face the struggle of a &quot;starving artist.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		&quot;I never feel comfortable to get profit for myself and it's difficult. 
		I'm still struggling with that,&quot; she says. <br>
		<br>
		Overall, painting at this time in her life is a learning experience, Liu 
		says. &quot;I have a dream to become a good painter and that keeps me going.&quot;<br>
		<br>
		Some portraits throughout her home are &quot;unfinished,&quot; and Liu says she 
		will gradually work on them. &quot;I feel that there is still a lot for me to 
		work on ... I am not tired of what I am doing yet,&quot; she says. <br>
